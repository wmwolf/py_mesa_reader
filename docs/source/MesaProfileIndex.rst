MesaProfileIndex
=============================================
`MesaProfileIndex` is a class that gives rudimentary access to the relationship
between profiles and model numbers typically stored in `profiles.index`. This
is mostly used on the backend of `MesaLogDir` to easily find profiles, but it
can also be used on its own.
